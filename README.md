# Profiler

Profiler provides a simple API onto Linux's perf_event_open to profile various counters.

It also has a simple commandline tool to enable profiling of functions in non-instrumented binaries using ptrace and breakpoints. This tool is very much incomplete.

For an example of using the C++ API, see the linear_iteration sample.
