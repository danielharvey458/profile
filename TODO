== General ==
* Make debugger a component that can work either in-process or out-of-process
* Write mini-benchmarking library around that component

== Useability ==
* Enable different types of measuring (address ranges, functions)

== Infrastructure ==
* Use ninja build system?
* Testing as much as possible

== Features ==
* Tracepoints (e.g. kmalloc)

== Function lookup ==
* Member functions
* Stateful and stateless lambda functions
* Template functions
* Functions in anonymous namespaces
* Functions in dynamically loaded libraries
