* Enable different types of measuring (address ranges, functions)
* Use perf event groups
* Initial regression testing
* Define measuring configuration format
* Use ninja build system?
* Testing as much as possible
* Tracepoints (e.g. kmalloc)
* How measure functions defined in other shared libraries
